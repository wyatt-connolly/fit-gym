    question: "What should I expect from my first personal training session?",
    answer:
      "Your first personal training session is an opportunity to get to know your trainer and decide if they are the right fit for you. Additionally, your personal trainer will use this chance to perform a number of initial fitness assessments that will help you track your progress as well as discuss your needs and long-term goals with you. \n\nAlthough the first part of your session will mostly focus on talking and paperwork, your Los Angeles personal trainer will probably make you sweat a bit in the second half. They’ll most likely have you do some basic exercises such as lunges, squats or kettlebell swings, just to assess your current fitness level and tailor your workout routine accordingly. They’ll also ask you about any injuries you might have had, or other medical conditions.",
